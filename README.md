# Hertie School's Data4Good Hackathon - Bristol Beees submission
### Description
This is a data visualisation tool for visualising Berlin's bike lanes and traffic accidents data. The tool has been coded with React and Javascript so they will need to be installed on your own device before running our tool locally.

### To run locally
In the terminal, type ```npm install```, and then
```npm start```.
 You may need to sudo delete node_modules and then re-install if you get react-script errors or other errors
i.e. try
```sudo rm -rf node_modules```
and then 
```npm install```
again.

### Misc (for venv setup):
venv should be in backend folder

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate # On Unix or MacOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
